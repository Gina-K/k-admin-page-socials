## How to run locally

1. Clone or download this repository.


2. Check if you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your computer (I used here Node v18.16.0 and npm 9.5.1):

   `node -v`

   `npm -v`


3. If you dont't have one, install **Node.js** and **npm** for your OS from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
   When you install Node.js, you automatically get npm installed.


4. Go to the project folder and install dependencies:

   `npm i`


5. Run the fake api in the first terminal window:

   `npm run api`


6. Run the app in the second terminal window:

   `npm run dev`

## Notes on used packages

1. **json-server**: simple solution for mocking API locally.


2. **FontAwesome**: handy icon library with plenty of free resources.
